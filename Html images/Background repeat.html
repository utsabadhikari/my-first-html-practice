<h2>Background Repeat</h2>

<p>
		 Note:You can avoid the image from being repeated by setting the background-repeat 
		property to "no-repeat".
</p>
	<p>
		Also:By default, the background image will repeat itself if it is smaller than the element where it is specified, in this case the body element.
